## Background
Reading is enjoyable, but finding what to read and where to buy books may not be that fun. Therefore, we came up with this solution -- a comprehensive book ranking tool using data from three main online bookstores, "Eslite Bookstore," "Kingstone Bookstore," and "books com tw." With our "Comprehensive Book Ranking Tool," we don't need to spend more time on browsing through several online bookstores to compare the rankings and selling prices. The tool provides a total ranking, the bookstore with the lowest price of a certain book, and the stock level with a click.

## Methodology
* Ranking: We collect data from three main bookstores, and score 10 for each book on the rankings. Then we compile and generate the list of the top 10 books with the highest scores.
* Recommended book provider: We check the selling price and stock level of each book on the list and provide the link of the bookstore with the lowest price.

## Result
As shown below, the tool generates a ranking of 10 books with basic information of the books and links to the most cost-effective places to buy the books.
